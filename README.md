Project Overview

Our goal is to develop an offline multilingual translator that can translate speech from one language to another without requiring an internet connection. As of now, we have implemented Arabic-to-English translation.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Language barriers pose significant challenges in regions with limited internet access, affecting communication in critical sectors like healthcare, emergency response, and education. Existing translation solutions depend on cloud-based services, making them unreliable in offline environments.

To overcome this, we are developing an offline multilingual speech translator that enables seamless language translation without an internet connection. Our initial implementation focuses on Arabic-to-English translation, ensuring real-time, reliable communication in low-connectivity areas.


PROPOSED SOLUTION:

We are developed "OffLingo", an offline speech-to-speech translator that enables real-time language translation without internet access. Unlike cloud-based solutions, it processes translations locally using Argos Translate, ensuring privacy, security, and accessibility.  

Our initial implementation focuses on Arabic-to-English translation, with plans to expand to additional languages. We are also exploring Raspberry Pi integration to enhance portability and usability in low-connectivity environments.  

OffLingo is designed for a range of users, including travelers, humanitarian workers, emergency responders, and military personnel. Its offline capabilities make it an invaluable tool for military personnel in the field, enabling seamless communication in critical situations without the need for an internet connection. The system bridges language barriers in remote or conflict zones, enhancing coordination and operational efficiency.


 How It Work:

Speech Input: The microphone records Arabic speech.
Speech-to-Text Conversion: Using the Vosk model, the Arabic speech is transcribed into text.
Text Translation: The transcribed Arabic text is translated to English using Argos Translate.
Text-to-Speech Output: The translated English text is converted into speech using pyttsx3.
